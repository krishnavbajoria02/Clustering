# Clustering
This project utilizes PCA, Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means, and KNN to cluster customers for targeted marketing. Kaggle dataset employed.

# Customer Segmentation Clustering Project

## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation, a crucial task in marketing and business analysis. By employing various clustering techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we aim to group customers with similar characteristics and behaviors. These clusters can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing and improved customer service.

## Dataset

We utilized a Kaggle dataset containing customer-related data, such as demographics, purchase history, and behavioral attributes. The dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/dataset-link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nataliaole/cc-general-clustering/input)) is available on Kaggle and contains essential information for our clustering analysis.

## Techniques Used

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** We applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. This technique simplifies the data for subsequent clustering algorithms.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Hierarchical clustering is used to create a dendrogram that visualizes the hierarchical relationships between data points. This approach helps identify natural clusters within the data.

3. **K-Means Clustering:** K-Means is a partitioning method that groups data points into K clusters based on similarity. We experimented with different values of K to find the optimal number of clusters.

4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN is employed for customer classification based on similarity to other customers. This method allows for customer grouping and recommendation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`CC_GENERAL/`:** Contains the dataset used for customer segmentation.
- **`Clustering_Project.ipynb/`:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and clustering using PCA, Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means, and KNN.
